		<table>Table 1: Basic Results </table>
		<table>Table 2: Results for individual feature sets. </table>
		<table>Table 3: Ablation study. Shown is the decrease in accuracy when we train a network that has all but the given set of features. The last line is shows the effect of removing the anchor, PageRank, and domain features, hence a model containing no network or link-based information whatsoever. </table>
		<table>Table 4: fRank performance as feature sets are added. At each row, the feature set that gave the greatest increase in accuracy was added to the list of features (i.e., we conducted a greedy search over feature sets). </table>
