the	0

0	0
Finally,	0

the	0

only	0
a	0

Second,	0
the	0

an	0
intuitive	0
0	0

0	0
There	0

in	0

we	0

this	0

0	0
First,	0
fRank	0
uses	0
only	0
a	0

We	0
believe	0
we	0
0	0
could	0
achieve	0
even	0
more	0
significant	0

with	0
more	0

In	0
0	0
particular	0
the	0
existence,	0

thereof,	0
of	0
certain	0

could	0
0	0
prove	0
very	0
significant	0
(for	0
instance,	0
under	0
construction	0
0	0
probably	0
signifies	0
a	0

Other	0

could	0
0	0
include	0

0	0
Many	0

For	0

it	0
may	0
be	0
0	0
useful	0
to	0
apply	0
the	0

found	0
in	0

to	0
form	0
a	0

0	0

for	0
the	0

of	0

The	0

itself	0
be	0
a	0

0	0
fRank	0
allows	0
one	0
to	0
specify	0
a	0
confidence	0
in	0
each	0

In	0
the	0
future,	0
we	0
will	0
experiment	0
with	0
probabilities	0
0	0
that	0
depend	0
on	0
the	0
difference	0
in	0
human	0
judgments	0
between	0
the	0
0	0
two	0
items	0
in	0
the	0

For	0
example,	0
a	0
pair	0
of	0
documents	0
where	0
one	0
0	0
was	0
rated	0
4	0
and	0
the	0
other	0
0	0
should	0
have	0
a	0

than	0
0	0
a	0
pair	0
of	0
documents	0
rated	0

0	0
The	0
experiments	0
in	0
this	0
paper	0
are	0
biased	0
toward	0

that	0
have	0
0	0

Also,	0

0	0
can	0
only	0
be	0
applied	0
to	0
pages	0
that	0
have	0
already	0
been	0
crawled.	0
0	0
Thus,	0
fRank	0
is	0
primarily	0
useful	0
for	0
index	0
ordering	0
and	0
improving	0
0	0
relevance,	0
not	0
for	0
directing	0

We	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
0	0
investigate	0
a	0
machine	0

approach	0
for	0
crawl	0
prioritization	0
as	0
0	0
well.	0
It	0
may	0
be	0
that	0
a	0
combination	0
of	0
methods	0
is	0
best:	0
for	0
0	0

0	0
Another	0

for	0

is	0
to	0

there	0
